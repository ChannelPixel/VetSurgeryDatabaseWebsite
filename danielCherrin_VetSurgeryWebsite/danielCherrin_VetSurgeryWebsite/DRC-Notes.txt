//NOTES:

/GridView
	- Making a boundfield.visible = false, keeps it's index position.
		However you have to set the control in the cell NOT the cell itself;
		otherwise this will visibly shift the index in the row's cells and 
		bind under the wrong header. IMPORTANT->accessing the text in an visible=false
		cell will return "";
	FOR OTHER FIELDS - To access the control user e.Row.Cells[*column index of the control*].Controls[0]
	FOR TEMPLATE FIELDS  - To access the control use e.Row.Cells[*column index of the control*].FindControl("*Control ID*")
